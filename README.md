# Deploy-Web-Apps-Using-Google-Colab-and-Ngrok

The objective of these projects is to help Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists to share their Web App Development with the world (temporarily) without much hassle — actually, just with a few lines of Python code and minimum dependency. 

We will be using:
* **ngrok** -  which is a cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed.
* **Jupyter Dash** - which is a library makes it easy to develop Plotly Dash apps interactively from within Jupyter environments (e.g. classic Notebook, JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code notebooks, nteract, PyCharm notebooks, etc.).
* **Dash** - Dash is Plotly’s open source Python (and R and Julia!) framework for building full stack analytic web applications using pure Python (no JavaScript required). Thanks to features like hot reloading and front-end error reporting provided by Dash DevTools, developers can quickly iterate on application designs using a traditional text editor or Integrated.

**Please note, this is not a production solution and you might want to know a lot more than simply tunneling in that case.**
